Present your findings on the final project, where you are tasked with
creating a Jupyter notebook from scratch and conducting a data
analysis on a dataset of your choice. This comprehensive process
involves selecting a dataset that piques your interest, exploring its
contents within a Jupyter notebook, and identifying research questions
that the data might help answer.


Guidelines:
1. Begin by finding a dataset that piques your interest. You can choose
from a list of places with valuable datasets provided in our reading, or
feel free to select data related to your hobbies or work if it is publicly
available.
2. Explore the dataset in a Jupyter notebook, gaining a deep
understanding of its contents. This exploration phase will help you
identify the types of questions that can be addressed using the available
data. Remember that data cleaning may be necessary during this step.
3. Based on your exploration, narrow down and define a research
question. Consider what specific information or insights you want to
derive from the dataset. Your research question should be tailored to
the characteristics of the data you have chosen.
4. Utilize various visualization techniques to analyze the dataset and
find a solution for your research problem. Visualization is a powerful
tool for uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
5. Throughout this process, pay close attention to the project description
and grading rubric to ensure that your work aligns with the project's
requirements and expectations.
6. By the end of this week, you should have not only selected a dataset
and formulated a clear research question but also utilized visualizations
to derive meaningful insights and solutions to your research problem.
